# SedimentIndices
Exploring utility of various sediment indices for unvalidated relative sediment concentrations

This analysis is an offshoot of DeltaSynchronocity repo. The intial work was using Aquasat database of tss and ssc values in the CONUS to determine what bands or band ratios tracked relative changes in sediment values best
